# American Veterans Rebuilding (AVR NPO) Website

Official website for American Veterans Rebuilding, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping combat veterans rebuild their lives through housing projects, skills training, and community support programs.

## About AVR NPO

American Veterans Rebuilding is formed by Combat Veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are soldiers who have lived through hell on earth and found a way to continue to dedicate our lives to the military's core values of Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity and Personal Courage.

## Website Features

### Public Features
- **Mission & About** - Information about AVR's mission and impact
- **Team Profiles** - Meet the combat veterans who founded and run AVR
- **Project Showcase** - Housing and community development projects
- **Contact Information** - Ways to reach out and get involved
- **Donation System** - Secure donation processing for supporter contributions (one-time and recurring)

## 🚨 Current Development Status

### Donation System Enhancement (IN PROGRESS)
The donation system is being enhanced to support true recurring monthly donations:

**Current Status:**
- ✅ One-time donations working perfectly with Helcim integration
- ⚠️ Recurring donations UI exists but only processes one-time payments
- 🔧 **Implementing unified payment architecture** for both donation types

**Implementation Plan:**
- **Unified Flow**: Use HelcimPay.js `verify` mode for ALL donations (cleaner architecture)
- **Backend Processing**: Route to appropriate API based on donation type
  - One-time → Payment API `purchase` with card token
  - Recurring → Recurring API subscription with card token

**Documentation:** See `/docs/helcim-recurring-implementation-plan.md` for complete technical details

*Supporting combat veterans in rebuilding their lives and strengthening communities.*

**Important**: Buffalo has built-in hot reload that automatically handles all file changes. Once you run `make dev`, the server stays running and automatically reloads when you make changes.

### How Auto-Reload Works
- **Go code changes** → Buffalo automatically recompiles and restarts the server
- **Template changes** → Templates reload instantly without server restart
- **Static assets** → CSS/JS changes update automatically via the asset pipeline
- **Database migrations** → Run migrations with `soda migrate up` while server runs

### Development Best Practices
- **Start once**: Run `make dev` at the beginning of your development session
- **Keep running**: Leave Buffalo running in the background throughout development
- **Just code**: Make your changes and refresh the browser to see updates
- **No manual restarts**: Buffalo handles all recompilation automatically

### When to Restart Buffalo
- **Compilation errors**: If Go code has syntax errors preventing compilation
- **Database issues**: If you need to reset the database state
- **Explicit request**: Only restart if specifically needed for debugging

**🚨 Never kill the Buffalo process during normal development** - it's designed to handle all changes automatically!

### First Admin User

To set up your first admin user:

1. **Register a user account** through the web interface
2. **Promote to admin** with one command:
   ```console
   make admin
   ```

This automatically promotes the first registered user to admin role, giving them access to the admin panel.

## 👑 Admin Management System

This template includes a role-based admin management system with basic CRUD operations and safety controls.

### Admin System Features

#### User Management
- **Basic CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete users
- **Role Assignment** - Change user roles between admin and user
- **User Management** - User listing with basic pagination
- **Safety Controls** - Admins cannot delete their own accounts

#### Admin Interface
- **Basic Dashboard** - User statistics and system overview
- **User Management Table** - User list with edit/delete actions
- **Role Management Forms** - Simple role assignment interface
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

#### Security Features
- **Authorization Middleware** - Admin routes protected with `AdminRequired` middleware
- **Role-Based Access** - UI shows/hides features based on user permissions
- **Session Security** - Session management with role verification
- **Input Validation** - Basic validation for admin operations

### Setting Up Admin Access

#### Automatic Admin Promotion
```console
# Promote the first registered user to admin
make admin
```

This grift task finds the first user (by creation date) and promotes them to admin role.

#### Manual Admin Promotion
```console
# Using Buffalo task directly
buffalo task db:promote_admin

# Or promote a specific user via database
psql -d my_go_saas_template_development -c "UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';"
```

### Admin Routes & API

| Route | Method | Description | Access Level |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `/admin` | GET | Admin dashboard with statistics | Admin Only |
| `/admin/users` | GET | User management list (paginated) | Admin Only |
| `/admin/users/{id}` | GET | Edit user form | Admin Only |
| `/admin/users/{id}` | POST | Update user (including role) | Admin Only |
| `/admin/users/{id}` | DELETE | Delete user (with safety checks) | Admin Only |

### Role System Details

#### User Roles
- **`user`** (default) - Standard application access
  - Profile management
  - Dashboard access
  - Standard features

- **`admin`** - Full administrative privileges
  - All user permissions
  - Admin panel access (`/admin`)
  - User management capabilities
  - Role assignment permissions
  - System administration

#### Role Enforcement
- **Database Level** - Role field with proper constraints and validation
- **Middleware Level** - `AdminRequired` middleware protects admin routes
- **Template Level** - Conditional rendering based on user role
- **UI Level** - Dynamic navigation and feature visibility

### Admin Development Patterns

#### Adding New Admin Features
```go
// In actions/app.go - Add new admin routes
adminGroup := app.Group("/admin")
adminGroup.Use(AdminRequired)
adminGroup.GET("/new-feature", AdminNewFeatureHandler)
```

#### Template Access Control
```html
<!-- In templates - Check admin role -->
<%= if (current_user.Role == "admin") { %>
  <a href="/admin">Admin Panel</a>
<% } %>
```

#### Safety Checks Example
```go
// Prevent self-deletion
if userToDelete.ID == currentUser.ID {
    return c.Error(400, errors.New("cannot delete your own account"))
}
```

### Development Tips

#### Buffalo Development Server
- **Automatic reload** - Buffalo watches files and reloads automatically
- **Port 3000** - Default development port
- **Hot reload** - Template and Go code changes reload automatically
- **Keep running** - Leave Buffalo running, it handles recompilation

#### Database Development
- **Container persistence** - Database data persists between restarts
- **Health checks** - Make commands wait for database readiness
- **Multiple environments** - Development, test, and production databases
- **Migration tracking** - Buffalo tracks applied migrations automatically

#### Template Development
- **HTMX integration** - Templates support dynamic content loading
- **Pico.css styling** - Semantic HTML with automatic styling
- **Plush templating** - Buffalo's template engine with Go-like syntax
- **Live reload** - Template changes appear immediately

**🚨 CRITICAL: Buffalo Template & Partial Guidelines**
- **Partial naming** - Partials MUST be prefixed with underscore: `_partial.plush.html`
- **Partial calls** - Reference without underscore or extension: `partial("auth/new")` finds `auth/_new.plush.html`
- **Universal layout** - Use HTMX content swapping with persistent header/footer instead of full page templates
- **Component architecture** - Create reusable partials for forms, content sections, navigation
- **Template structure** - Direct route visits should load universal layout with content, HTMX requests load partials only

**Template Architecture Pattern:**
```go
// In action handler
func MyPageHandler(c buffalo.Context) error {
    if c.Request().Header.Get("HX-Request") == "true" {
        return c.Render(http.StatusOK, rHTMX.HTML("mypage/_content.plush.html"))
    }
    // Direct visits get universal layout with content flag
    c.Set("myPageContent", true)
    return c.Render(http.StatusOK, r.HTML("home/index.plush.html"))
}
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Database Connection Issues**
```console
# Check container status
make db-status
podman-compose ps

# Check logs
podman-compose logs postgres

# Reset database if corrupted
make db-reset
```

**Buffalo Issues**
```console
# Check if Buffalo is running
ps aux | grep buffalo
lsof -i :3000

# Restart Buffalo if needed
# Ctrl+C to stop, then: make dev
```

**Port Conflicts**
```console
# Check what's using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill process if needed
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)
```

**Template Errors**
- Check Buffalo console output for Plush syntax errors
- Ensure proper variable names and template structure
- Verify HTMX attributes and targets are correct

## 🔐 Authentication Features

### User Registration & Login
- **Registration**: `/users/new` - Create new user accounts (form loads in a modal via HTMX)
- **Login**: `/auth/new` - Sign in with email/password (form loads in a modal via HTMX)
- **Dashboard**: `/dashboard` - Protected area for authenticated users (content loads via HTMX)
- **Logout**: Available via user dropdown menu (uses HTMX POST)

### User Interface
- **Persistent Header/Footer**: The main site header (with navigation, theme toggle, profile/auth links) and footer are defined in `templates/home/index.plush.html` and persist across page views using `hx-preserve="true"`.
- **Dynamic Content Area**: The `<main id="htmx-content">` in `index.plush.html` is where page-specific content is dynamically loaded by HTMX.
- **Modal Authentication Forms**: "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons in the header trigger Pico.css modals. The respective forms are loaded into these modals via HTMX.
- **Landing Page**: Marketing page with conditional CTAs. Login/Signup CTAs open modals.
- **User Dropdown**: Professional dropdown menu in the persistent header for authenticated users with:
  - User avatar (initials with gradient background)
  - User name display
  - Profile Settings (placeholder, loads via HTMX)
  - Account Settings (placeholder, loads via HTMX)  
  - Sign Out functionality (HTMX POST request)

### Authentication Flow
1. Unauthenticated users see the landing page. "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons in the header open modals with the respective forms, loaded via HTMX.
2. After successful login/signup from a modal, the server typically responds with an `HX-Refresh: true` header, causing a full page refresh. This updates the header to the logged-in state and closes the modal.
3. Authenticated users see the persistent header with their profile dropdown. Navigating to areas like `/dashboard` loads the content into the `#htmx-content` area.
4. Logout (via an HTMX POST request from the dropdown) clears the session and typically triggers an `HX-Refresh: true` or `HX-Redirect` to the landing page.

## ✨ HTMX Integration

This template heavily utilizes HTMX for a modern, single-page application feel without complex JavaScript frameworks.

- **Core Principle**: The main layout (`templates/home/index.plush.html`) acts as a persistent shell. Navigation links and form submissions use HTMX attributes (`hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-target`, `hx-swap`) to fetch HTML fragments from the server and swap them into the `#htmx-content` div.
- **Initial Page Load**: The homepage (`/`) loads `index.plush.html`, and the `<main id="htmx-content">` tag has an `hx-trigger="load"` attribute that immediately makes an HTMX request to fetch the initial homepage content (`_index_content.plush.html`).
- **Server-Side Handling**:
    - Go handlers in the `actions` package detect HTMX requests (using `IsHTMX(c.Request())` from `actions/render.go`).
    - For HTMX requests, handlers use a specific render engine (`rHTMX`) that employs a minimal layout (`templates/htmx.plush.html`, which is just `<%= yield %>`). This ensures only the necessary HTML fragment is sent to the client.
    - Standard (non-HTMX) requests render full pages using the default engine (`r`) and `templates/application.plush.html` (which now primarily serves `index.plush.html` for the main app view).
- **Benefits**: Reduced page flicker, faster perceived load times for content changes, and simpler server-rendered HTML.

### HTMX Integration Architecture

#### Core Concept
The application uses a persistent shell architecture where the main layout stays loaded and content areas are dynamically updated via HTMX.

#### Key Components
1. **Persistent Shell** (`templates/home/index.plush.html`)
   - Header with navigation and user menu
   - Footer with site information
   - `<main id="htmx-content">` target area

2. **Content Partials** (Various template files)
   - Dashboard content (`templates/home/dashboard.plush.html`)
   - Admin interfaces (`templates/admin/*.plush.html`)
   - User forms (`templates/users/*.plush.html`)

3. **HTMX Response Engine** (`actions/render.go`)
   - Detects HTMX requests via headers
   - Uses minimal layout for partial responses
   - Maintains full page rendering for direct access

#### Benefits
- **Faster Navigation** - Only content area updates, header/footer persist
- **Better UX** - No page flicker during navigation
- **SEO Friendly** - Full pages still render for search engines
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Works without JavaScript as fallback

### Security Architecture

#### Authentication Security
- **Session Management** - Session cookies with expiration
- **Password Hashing** - bcrypt with appropriate cost factor
- **CSRF Protection** - Built-in Buffalo CSRF middleware
- **Input Validation** - Basic validation on user inputs

#### Authorization Security
- **Role-Based Access** - Middleware-enforced role checking
- **Route Protection** - Admin routes protected with `AdminRequired` middleware
- **Template Security** - Role-based conditional rendering
- **API Security** - Authorization checks on endpoints

#### Database Security
- **Prepared Statements** - All queries use parameterization
- **Connection Pooling** - Database connection management
- **Migration Tracking** - Database schema version control
- **Data Validation** - Model-level validation before database operations

### Performance Optimizations

#### Frontend Performance
- **Minimal JavaScript** - HTMX provides dynamic behavior with minimal JS
- **Semantic CSS** - Pico.css provides styling without utility class bloat
- **Template Rendering** - Plush templates for server-side rendering
- **Static Asset Optimization** - Minified CSS and optimized images

#### Backend Performance
- **Compiled Go Binary** - High-performance compiled application
- **Connection Pooling** - Database connection management
- **Session Optimization** - Session storage and retrieval
- **Template Caching** - Plush templates cached in production

#### Database Performance
- **Indexed Queries** - Indexing on frequently queried columns
- **Query Optimization** - Efficient queries
- **Connection Limits** - Connection pool sizing
- **Migration Efficiency** - Non-blocking migrations where possible

## 🛠️ Development

### Template Development

This project uses Buffalo's Plush templating engine, Pico.css for styling, and HTMX for dynamic interactions.

**Important: For ALL styling changes, always consult `/docs/` folder FIRST**

- **Main Shell**: `templates/home/index.plush.html` is the primary persistent layout containing the header, footer, and the `<main id="htmx-content">` target.
- **Content Partials**: Most page-specific content is in separate partial files (e.g., `templates/home/_index_content.plush.html`, `templates/home/dashboard.plush.html`). These are loaded into `#htmx-content`.
- **HTMX Fragments Layout**: `templates/htmx.plush.html` (containing just `<%= yield %>`) is used by the `rHTMX` render engine for HTMX responses.
- **Plush Syntax**: See `/docs/buffalo-template-syntax.md`.
- **Pico.css Styling**: **CRITICAL** - See `/docs/pico-implementation-guide.md` and `/docs/pico-css-variables.md` - Use Pico CSS variables instead of custom CSS
- **Modals**: Pico.css `<dialog>` elements are used for login/signup, triggered by JavaScript and populated by HTMX.
- **Theme Switching**: Built-in dark/light/auto mode support, works with the persistent header.

#### Pico.css Styling Guidelines
- **Always use CSS variables**: Modify `--pico-primary`, `--pico-background-color`, etc. instead of writing custom CSS
- **Check documentation first**: Consult `/docs/pico-css-variables.md` for all available Pico variables
- **Use semantic HTML**: Follow patterns in `/docs/pico-implementation-guide.md` for proper Pico.css usage
- **Never override Pico directly**: Work within Pico's variable system for all customization

### Database Management
The application includes a PostgreSQL container configured via `docker-compose.yml`:
- **Development DB**: `my_go_saas_template_development`
- **Test DB**: `my_go_saas_template_test`
- **Production DB**: `my_go_saas_template_production`

### Common Commands
```console
# Development shortcuts (recommended)
make dev                       # Start everything for development
make setup                     # First-time setup
make test                      # Run tests
make clean                     # Stop and cleanup
make admin                     # Promote first user to admin

# Manual commands
# Database operations
soda create -a                 # Create databases
soda migrate up                # Run migrations
soda generate migration        # Create new migration

# Admin management
buffalo task db:promote_admin  # Promote first user to admin role

# Development
buffalo dev                    # Start dev server with hot reload
buffalo build                  # Build production binary

# Testing - CRITICAL USAGE REQUIREMENTS
buffalo test ./actions         # Test actions package (RECOMMENDED)
buffalo test ./models          # Test models package  
buffalo test ./pkg             # Test pkg package
buffalo test ./actions ./models ./pkg  # Test multiple packages
buffalo test ./actions -v      # Test with verbose output

# ❌ DO NOT USE THESE COMMANDS:
# buffalo test ./...           # Includes problematic backup directory
# go test ./actions            # Bypasses Buffalo test setup

# Container management (Podman/Docker)
podman-compose up -d           # Start database
podman-compose down            # Stop database
podman-compose ps              # Check container status
```
User management endpoints (`/users`, `/auth`) are still the same, but interactions are now primarily via HTMX from modals or links.

## 🤖 Bot Instructions

When working with this Buffalo SaaS template:

### Template Development & HTMX
1.  **Understand the Shell**: `templates/home/index.plush.html` is the persistent shell. Most new content should be a partial loaded into `#htmx-content`.
2.  **HTMX Attributes**: Use `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-target="#htmx-content"`, `hx-swap` for navigation and forms. For modals, target the modal's content div.
3.  **Server-Side**:
    *   Check for HTMX requests using `IsHTMX(c.Request())`.
    *   Use `rHTMX.HTML("path/to/partial.plush.html")` for HTMX responses.
    *   Use `r.HTML("home/index.plush.html")` for initial full page loads of the main app view.
4.  **Plush Syntax**: Refer to `/docs/buffalo-template-syntax.md`. Avoid Go-style operations.
5.  **Modals**: Login/signup forms are in modals. Ensure HTMX attributes on trigger buttons target modal content divs. Server responses for modal forms (e.g., validation errors) should re-render the form fragment. Successful modal submissions often use `HX-Refresh: true`.

### Styling with Pico.css

**CRITICAL: Always use Pico.css variables instead of custom CSS**

1.  **Semantic HTML**: Key for Pico.css - use proper HTML elements
2.  **CSS Variables Only**: Modify `--pico-primary`, `--pico-background-color`, etc. instead of writing custom CSS
3.  **Documentation First**: Always check `/docs/pico-css-variables.md` and `/docs/pico-implementation-guide.md` BEFORE making styling changes
4.  **Modals**: Use `<dialog>` and `<article>` structure as documented in `/docs/`
5.  **Theme Support**: Use CSS variables to ensure compatibility with dark/light modes

### Authentication & Authorization
1.  **Modal Forms**: Login/signup are via modals loaded with HTMX.
2.  **Session Management**: `current_user_id` in session, `current_user` in templates.
3.  **Role-based Access**: Check `current_user.Role` for admin functionality.
4.  **Admin Middleware**: Use `AdminRequired` middleware for admin-only routes.
5.  **Post-Login/Signup**: Usually `HX-Refresh: true` from server.

### Admin System Patterns
1.  **Admin Routes**: Group under `/admin` with `AdminRequired` middleware.
2.  **Role Checks**: Use `current_user.Role == "admin"` in templates for conditional content.
3.  **User Management**: CRUD operations follow Buffalo conventions with proper validation.
4.  **Safety Checks**: Always prevent users from deleting themselves or escalating beyond their permissions.

### Common Patterns
- **Persistent Elements**: Header/footer in `index.plush.html` use `hx-preserve="true"`.
- **Conditional Content**: Check `current_user` for auth-specific content, often within partials.
- **Form Handling**: Standard Buffalo form helpers can be used, but HTMX attributes handle submission.

### Troubleshooting
- **500 errors**: Often Plush syntax. Check Buffalo logs.
- **HTMX Issues**: Use browser dev tools (Network tab) to inspect HTMX requests and responses. Check `HX-Request` headers and what HTML fragments are being returned. Ensure `hx-target` and `hx-swap` are correct.

### Buffalo Testing - CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**🚨 ALWAYS use Buffalo test commands, NEVER use `go test` directly!**

#### Required Testing Commands:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Test specific packages
buffalo test ./actions         # Test actions package only
buffalo test ./models          # Test models package only  
buffalo test ./pkg             # Test pkg package only
buffalo test ./actions ./models ./pkg  # Test multiple packages
buffalo test ./actions -v      # Test with verbose output

# ❌ WRONG - These will fail or cause issues
buffalo test ./...             # Includes problematic backup directory
go test ./actions              # Bypasses Buffalo's test setup
go test ./...                  # Bypasses Buffalo entirely
```

#### Buffalo Test Process:
Buffalo test automatically:
1. Drops and recreates test database (`avrnpo_test`)
2. Dumps schema from development database  
3. Loads schema into test database
4. Runs Go tests with Buffalo flags (`-p 1 -tags development`)

#### Database Requirements:
- **PostgreSQL Version**: 17+ (upgraded from 15 to fix transaction_timeout errors)
- **Container Management**: Use `podman-compose up -d` to start database
- **Schema Management**: Use `soda migrate up` (NOT `buffalo pop migrate`)

#### If Tests Fail:
1. **Check PostgreSQL**: `podman ps` to verify database container is running
2. **Check Schema**: `GO_ENV=test soda migrate status` to verify migrations
3. **Check Compilation**: Look for Go syntax errors in test output
4. **Exclude Backup Dir**: Never include `backup/` directory in test patterns

See `/docs/buffalo-test-debugging-summary.md` for complete troubleshooting guide.

## 🤖 Development Assistant Instructions

When working with this Buffalo SaaS template, follow these patterns and guidelines:

#### Template Development & HTMX Integration
1. **Understand the Shell Architecture**: `templates/home/index.plush.html` is the persistent shell. Most new content should be a partial template loaded into `#htmx-content`.

2. **HTMX Response Patterns**: 
   - Use `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-target="#htmx-content"`, `hx-swap` for navigation and forms
   - For modals, target the modal's content div specifically
   - Server responses use `rHTMX.HTML("path/to/partial.plush.html")` for HTMX requests

3. **Template Engine Guidelines**:
   - Check for HTMX requests using `IsHTMX(c.Request())` in handlers
   - Use `r.HTML("home/index.plush.html")` for initial full page loads
   - Reference `/docs/buffalo-template-syntax.md` for Plush syntax patterns

#### Styling with Pico.css Framework

**CRITICAL: Always consult `/docs/` folder before making ANY styling changes**

1. **Documentation First**: Check `/docs/pico-css-variables.md` and `/docs/pico-implementation-guide.md` BEFORE styling
2. **CSS Variables Only**: Use `--pico-primary`, `--pico-background-color`, etc. - NEVER write custom CSS rules
3. **Semantic HTML First**: Use proper HTML elements (`<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<details>`) as shown in `/docs/`
4. **Minimal CSS Classes**: Prefer `role="button"`, `class="secondary"`, `class="dropdown"` over custom styles
5. **Theme Compatibility**: Use CSS variables to ensure dark/light mode compatibility
6. **Responsive Design**: Trust Pico.css responsive behavior, avoid custom breakpoints unless necessary

#### Authentication & Authorization Patterns
1. **Modal Authentication**: Login/signup forms load via HTMX into modal dialogs
2. **Session Management**: Use `current_user_id` in session, `current_user` available in templates
3. **Role-Based Access**: Check `current_user.Role` for admin functionality in templates
4. **Admin Middleware**: Always use `AdminRequired` middleware for admin-only routes
5. **Post-Authentication**: Use `HX-Refresh: true` header for successful modal form submissions

#### Admin System Development
1. **Route Structure**: Group admin routes under `/admin` with `AdminRequired` middleware protection
2. **Role Checking**: Use `current_user.Role == "admin"` in templates for conditional content
3. **CRUD Operations**: Follow Buffalo conventions with proper validation and error handling
4. **Safety Controls**: Always prevent users from deleting themselves or escalating beyond permissions

#### Database & Migration Patterns
1. **Migration Safety**: Use non-blocking migrations where possible for production deployments
2. **Model Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation at the model level
3. **Role System**: Use `role` field with proper constraints and default values
4. **UUID Primary Keys**: Maintain UUID usage for security and scalability

#### Common Development Patterns
- **Persistent Elements**: Header/footer use `hx-preserve="true"` to maintain state
- **Conditional Content**: Check `current_user` for authentication-specific content rendering
- **Form Handling**: Use HTMX attributes for submission while maintaining Buffalo form helpers
- **Error Handling**: Provide comprehensive error messages and proper HTTP status codes

#### Testing & Quality Assurance
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain tests for all authentication and admin functionality
- **Database Testing**: Use test database environment for isolated test runs
- **HTMX Testing**: Test both HTMX and direct URL access for all routes
- **Role Testing**: Verify proper authorization for all role-based features

#### Troubleshooting Guidelines
- **500 Errors**: Usually Plush template syntax issues - check Buffalo console output
- **HTMX Issues**: Use browser dev tools Network tab to inspect HTMX requests/responses
- **Database Issues**: Use `make db-status` and `make db-logs` for diagnostics
- **Permission Issues**: Verify middleware application and role assignments

## 📝 Development Roadmap

### 🚀 Unified Logging Implementation Plan

**Status**: Planning Phase - Not Started

Buffalo already has a solid logging foundation via `gobuffalo/logger` (logrus-based). This plan enhances it with configurability and structured business event logging.

#### **📋 Current State Analysis**

**✅ What Buffalo Already Provides:**
- [x] Built-in structured logging with request IDs, timing, status codes
- [x] paramlogger middleware for HTTP request logging  
- [x] Context-aware logger via `c.Logger()`
- [x] Log levels (info, debug, error, etc.)
- [x] JSON-like structured output

**❌ What's Missing:**
- [ ] Configurable file output location
- [ ] Consistent application-level logging
- [ ] Business event logging (user actions, errors)
- [ ] Centralized logging configuration

#### **🎯 Implementation Phases**

##### **Phase 1: Configuration & File Output** 
- [ ] Create logging configuration structure
  - [ ] Environment-based log levels (`LOG_LEVEL`)
  - [ ] Configurable file paths with sensible defaults (`LOG_FILE_PATH`)
  - [ ] Development vs production settings
- [ ] Add file output support
  - [ ] Default: `/logs/application.log`
  - [ ] Log rotation support
- [ ] Enhance Buffalo's existing logger
  - [ ] Keep Buffalo's middleware logging (already good)
  - [ ] Add custom fields for business context
  - [ ] Configure log level via environment

##### **Phase 2: Structured Application Logging**
- [ ] Create centralized logging service
  - [ ] Wrapper around Buffalo's logger
  - [ ] Consistent field names and formats
  - [ ] Request correlation ID support
- [ ] Add business event logging
  - [ ] User registration/login/logout events
  - [ ] Admin actions (user management, role changes)
  - [ ] Error tracking with context
  - [ ] Security events (failed login attempts, etc.)

##### **Phase 3: Integration & Standards**
- [ ] Update existing codebase
  - [ ] Replace scattered `c.Logger().Debugf()` calls
  - [ ] Add structured logging to key business flows
  - [ ] Standardize error logging
- [ ] Documentation and guidelines
  - [ ] Logging standards for the team
  - [ ] Examples and best practices

#### **🔧 Technical Implementation Details**

**Directory Structure:**
```
logs/
├── application.log          # Main application logs
├── access.log              # HTTP request logs (optional)
├── error.log               # Error-only logs
└── audit.log               # Security/admin events
```

**Configuration Approach:**
- Use Buffalo's existing logger infrastructure (don't reinvent)
- Environment variables for configuration
- Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- Compatible with Docker/container deployments

**Log Levels & Events:**
- **INFO**: User actions, business events
- **WARN**: Unusual but handled conditions
- **ERROR**: Application errors, failed operations
- **DEBUG**: Development debugging (current usage)

**Structured Fields Standard:**
- `user_id`: Current user context
- `request_id`: Buffalo's existing request IDs
- `action`: Business action being performed
- `resource`: What resource is being acted upon
- `ip_address`: Client IP for security events

I am a loving father to my daughter Madeline, and husband to my wife Jessica. I served in the ARMY as Active Duty Infantry from 2004 to 2007 where I formed a brotherhood with Sergio and Joshua. We shared three years and a combat tour to Ramadi together. I then earned the 37F MOS in 2007 and served until 2010 as a Psychological Operations Specialist. I separated from the ARMY in late 2010 and began my personal business, American Veterans Renovations, and have been improving homes ever since. While running my business I met my wife, Jessica, who continues to inspire me to improve myself and to work for more. American Veterans Rebuilding is the dream that we all hope to achieve together.</p>

I'm currently working with Kaweah Delta in Southern California in the Emergency and Cardiac department. The challenges I encounter at work push me to the limits of my experience, skills, and knowledge, which brings out the best in me. I was honored to serve my community during the COVID pandemic. I graduated from California State University, Bakersfield in 2018 with a bachelor's degree in Nursing. In 2002, I answered the nation's call and joined the U.S Army, while serving a total of nine years. I earned the rank of Staff Sergeant and endured two combat deployments in Iraq. I am excited to join my brothers in arms on our new venture. We look forward to serving our brothers and sisters in the armed forces, while helping them acquire stability, shelter, and desirable job skills.</p>

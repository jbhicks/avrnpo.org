  <h1>AVR Projects</h1>
  <p>
    The American Veterans Rebuilding Home Ownership Option is based on veteran participants 
    completing training offered through AVR and funded by donations.
  </p>
  
  <p>Through the AVR Home Ownership Option, veteran participants will be able to:</p>
  <ol class="projects-benefits">
    <li>Become certified in a trade they can depend on to provide for their families.</li>
    <li>Become a member of professional networking as well as a community of like minded veterans who have lived similar experiences.</li>
    <li>Have an opportunity to purchase a home at project cost rather than today's inflated market values.</li>
    <li>Build personal equity in the appraised value of the home to assist in future loans for personal or professional development.</li>
  </ol>

    American Veterans Rebuilding is formed by veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
    We are soldiers who have lived through hell on earth and found a way to continue to dedicate our lives 
    to the military's core values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage.

## 🧪 DONATION SYSTEM TESTING GUIDE

### Development Mode Testing

The donation system is designed for safe testing in development mode with real Helcim integration but test transactions.

#### Prerequisites
1. **Environment Setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
   ```bash
   # Helcim Configuration (Required)
   HELCIM_PRIVATE_API_KEY=your_actual_helcim_api_key
   HELCIM_TEST_MODE=true
   
   # Email Configuration (Optional for testing)
   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
   SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
   FROM_EMAIL=donations@avrnpo.org
   FROM_NAME=American Veterans Rebuilding
   ```

2. **Buffalo Server Running**: Ensure `buffalo dev` is running on port 3000

#### Step-by-Step Testing Process

##### 1. Access Donation Page
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/donate`
- You should see a blue "Development Mode" banner with test card information

##### 2. Fill Donation Form
- **Amount**: Select preset amount ($25, $50, etc.) or enter custom amount
- **Donor Information**: Enter any test data
- **Donation Type**: Choose "One-time" or "Recurring"

##### 3. Test Payment Processing
- Click "Donate Now" button
- HelcimPay modal will open with test card information displayed
- **Use Test Cards**:
  - **Visa**: 4111 1111 1111 1111
  - **Mastercard**: 5555 5555 5555 4444
  - **CVV**: 123
  - **Expiry**: 12/25 (or any future date)
  - **Name/ZIP**: Any test data

##### 4. Test Different Scenarios

**Successful Payment**:
- Use valid test card numbers above
- Should redirect to `/donate/success` page
- Check Buffalo logs for success webhook processing

**Failed Payment**:
- Use invalid card: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- Should show error message and stay on form

**Test Webhook Processing**:
- Monitor Buffalo logs during payment processing
- Look for webhook event logs like:
  ```
  INFO: Received Helcim webhook: type=payment_success, id=..., transactionId=...
  INFO: Payment completed for donation ID: ..., amount: $25.00
  ```

##### 5. Email Receipt Testing

**If Email Configured**:
- Successful test payments will send actual emails to the donor email address entered
- Check your inbox for donation receipt emails
- Email will contain donation details and tax receipt information

**If Email Not Configured**:
- Buffalo logs will show: `email service not configured - missing environment variables`
- Webhook processing continues normally (emails are non-blocking)
- No emails sent but all other functionality works

#### Database Verification

**Check Donation Records**:
1. Access admin dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin/donations` (requires admin user)
2. Or query database directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, amount, donor_name, donor_email, status, created_at 
   FROM donations 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

**Expected Data**:
- Status starts as "pending"
- Status updates to "completed" after successful webhook
- Status updates to "failed" for declined payments

#### Admin Dashboard Testing

**Prerequisites**: User with admin role
**Access**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/donations`

**Features to Test**:
- View all donations with pagination
- Filter by status (pending, completed, failed)
- Search by donor name or email
- View individual donation details
- Real-time statistics and analytics

#### Webhook Testing

**Manual Webhook Testing**:
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/helcim \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Helcim-Signature: sha256=test_signature" \
  -d '{
    "id": "test_event_123",
    "type": "payment_success",
    "data": {
      "id": "payment_123",
      "amount": 25.00,
      "currency": "USD",
      "status": "completed",
      "transactionId": "txn_test_123"
    }
  }'
```

#### Common Testing Issues

**Issue**: "404 Not Found" on donation page
**Solution**: Ensure Buffalo server is running and routes are loaded

**Issue**: "Invalid signature" webhook errors
**Solution**: Set `HELCIM_WEBHOOK_VERIFIER_TOKEN` or run in development mode

**Issue**: No emails received
**Solution**: Configure SMTP settings in `.env` or check spam folder

**Issue**: Payment modal doesn't open
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

#### Production vs Development Differences

| Feature | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Card Processing | Test cards only | Real cards |
| Email Receipts | Optional (if configured) | Required |
| Webhook Signatures | Bypassed if not configured | Strictly validated |
| Transaction Charges | No real money | Real transactions |
| Error Logging | Verbose console output | Structured logging |

### Expected Testing Results

**Successful Test Flow**:
1. ✅ Donation form loads and accepts input
2. ✅ Payment modal opens with test card info
3. ✅ Test payment processes successfully
4. ✅ Redirects to success page
5. ✅ Webhook updates donation status to "completed"
6. ✅ Email receipt sent (if configured)
7. ✅ Admin dashboard shows completed donation

**This confirms the entire donation system is working correctly and ready for production deployment.**

# Helcim Integration Methods Analysis

**Date**: June 24, 2025  
**Analysis of**: Helcim payment processing integration options for AVR NPO

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After thorough examination of Helcim's documentation and APIs, there are **multiple integration methods** with different capabilities. The current AVR implementation only uses basic one-time payments, missing the full recurring billing capabilities.

## 🔍 AVAILABLE HELCIM INTEGRATION METHODS

### 1. HelcimPay.js (Currently Implemented)
**Purpose**: Secure payment collection via iframe modal  
**Use Case**: One-time payments, payment method verification  
**Recurring Support**: ❌ No (one-time payments only)

#### Current Implementation:
```javascript
// What we're doing now
const helcimRequest = {
    paymentType: "purchase",  // One-time payment
    amount: 100.00,
    currency: "USD"
};
```

#### Enhanced Capabilities Available:
```javascript
// What we COULD be doing for recurring
const helcimRequest = {
    paymentType: "verify",    // Store payment method without charging
    amount: 100.00,
    currency: "USD",
    customerRequest: {        // Create customer + vault payment method
        contactName: "John Doe",
        email: "john@example.com"
    }
};
```

**Recurring Implementation**: Use `paymentType: "verify"` to store payment methods, then create subscriptions via Recurring API.

### 2. Helcim Recurring API (NOT Implemented)
**Purpose**: Subscription and recurring billing management  
**Use Case**: True recurring payments, subscription services  
**Recurring Support**: ✅ Full recurring billing system

#### Key Components:
1. **Payment Plans** - Define billing frequency and amounts
2. **Subscriptions** - Link customers to payment plans  
3. **Customer Vault** - Store payment methods securely
4. **Automatic Billing** - Helcim handles recurring charges

#### Implementation Pattern:
```go
// Step 1: Create payment plan (one-time setup)
POST /payment-plans
{
    "planName": "Monthly Donation - $50",
    "amount": 50.00,
    "frequency": "monthly",
    "currency": "USD"
}

// Step 2: Create subscription (per recurring donor)
POST /subscriptions  
{
    "customerId": "customer-from-helcimpayjs",
    "paymentPlanId": "plan-id-from-step-1", 
    "amount": 50.00,
    "paymentMethod": "cc"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Automatic monthly billing
- Built-in failed payment handling
- Subscription management (pause, cancel, modify)
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

### 3. Customer API (NOT Implemented)
**Purpose**: Customer management and payment method storage  
**Use Case**: Customer profiles, payment method vault, relationship management  
**Recurring Support**: ✅ Supports payment method storage for recurring use

#### Key Features:
- **Customer Records** - Store donor information
- **Card Vault** - Securely store payment methods
- **Bank Account Storage** - ACH/bank payment options
- **Default Payment Methods** - Set preferred payment method per customer

#### Use with Recurring:
```go
// Retrieve customer's stored payment methods
GET /customers/{customerId}/cards

// Set default payment method for subscriptions  
POST /customers/{customerId}/cards/{cardId}/set-default
```

---

### 4. Payment API (Available, Not Needed)
**Purpose**: Direct payment processing (server-to-server)  
**Use Case**: Backend payment processing, complex integrations  
**Recurring Support**: ❌ One-time payments only (but can use stored payment methods)

**Note**: Not recommended for new implementations due to PCI compliance requirements. HelcimPay.js is preferred.

---

### 5. Invoice API (Available, Potential Future Use)
**Purpose**: Invoice creation and management  
**Use Case**: Formal invoicing, payment tracking  
**Recurring Support**: ❌ Individual invoices (but can be automated)

**Potential Use**: Generate formal donation receipts, track large donations.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED INTEGRATION STRATEGY

### For AVR NPO Donation System:

#### **Current State**: Basic HelcimPay.js (one-time only)
- ✅ Secure payment collection
- ❌ No recurring billing capability
- ❌ Misleading "monthly recurring" option

#### **Recommended State**: Hybrid Integration
**Combine HelcimPay.js + Recurring API + Customer API**

1. **One-time Donations**: Continue using HelcimPay.js with `paymentType: "purchase"`

2. **Recurring Donations**: Two-step process
   - **Step 1**: HelcimPay.js with `paymentType: "verify"` (store payment method)
   - **Step 2**: Recurring API to create subscription

3. **Customer Management**: Use Customer API for donor profiles and payment method management

#### **Implementation Flow**:
```
User selects "Monthly $50"
    ↓
Frontend: HelcimPay.js verify mode
    ↓  
Payment method stored + Customer created
    ↓
Backend: Create subscription via Recurring API
    ↓
Helcim: Automatic monthly billing begins
    ↓
Webhooks: Payment success/failure notifications
```

## 📊 INTEGRATION COMPARISON

| Method | One-Time Payments | Recurring Payments | Customer Vault | PCI Compliance | Implementation Complexity |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **HelcimPay.js** | ✅ Excellent | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (with verify) | ✅ Full | 🟢 Low |
| **Recurring API** | ❌ No | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Required | ✅ Full | 🟡 Medium |
| **Customer API** | ❌ No | ✅ Support only | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Full | 🟡 Medium |
| **Payment API** | ✅ Good | ❌ No | ✅ Can use vault | ⚠️ High Requirements | 🔴 High |
| **Invoice API** | ✅ Via invoices | ❌ Manual only | ❌ No | ✅ Full | 🟡 Medium |

## 🚨 CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

### ❌ What's Wrong:
1. **False Advertising**: UI offers "monthly recurring" but only processes one-time payments
2. **Donor Confusion**: People think they've set up monthly giving but haven't
3. **Lost Revenue**: No automatic recurring donations happening
4. **Manual Overhead**: No way to track or manage recurring donors

### ✅ What Needs to Be Fixed:
1. **Implement Recurring API**: Create actual subscriptions for monthly donors
2. **Two-Track System**: Separate flows for one-time vs recurring donations
3. **Customer Management**: Store donor information and payment methods
4. **Subscription Tracking**: Database and admin interface for managing recurring gifts

## 🛠️ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

### **IMMEDIATE (This Sprint)**
1. ✅ Document the current problem (DONE)
2. ✅ Create implementation plan (DONE)
3. 🔲 Remove or clearly label "monthly recurring" option until fixed
4. 🔲 Begin backend Recurring API integration

### **SHORT-TERM (Next 2 Weeks)**
1. 🔲 Complete Recurring API integration
2. 🔲 Test end-to-end recurring donation flow
3. 🔲 Deploy proper recurring billing system
4. 🔲 Validate with test transactions

### **MEDIUM-TERM (Next Month)**  
1. 🔲 Add subscription management for donors
2. 🔲 Implement customer portal for payment method updates
3. 🔲 Enhanced reporting for recurring vs one-time donations
4. 🔲 Automated email communications for recurring donors

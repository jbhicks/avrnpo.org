# Production Deployment & Operations

Production deployment, security, and monitoring for the AVR NPO donation system.

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Documentation

### ðŸš€ Production Deployment
- **[Production Checklist](./production-checklist.md)** - Go-live requirements and verification *(planned)*
- **[Environment Setup](./environment-setup.md)** - Production environment configuration *(planned)*

### ðŸ”’ Security & Compliance
- **[Security Guidelines](./security.md)** - Security best practices and requirements
- **[PCI Compliance](./pci-compliance.md)** - Payment security requirements *(planned)*

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Operations
- **[Monitoring](./monitoring.md)** - Logging, metrics, and alerting *(planned)*
- **[Backup & Recovery](./backup-recovery.md)** - Data protection procedures *(planned)*

## ðŸŽ¯ Production Environment

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Linux server** - Ubuntu 20.04+ or similar
- **PostgreSQL** - Version 13+ for production database
- **Reverse proxy** - Nginx or similar for HTTPS termination
- **SSL certificate** - Valid certificate for secure connections
- **Email service** - SMTP for donation receipts and notifications

### Security Considerations
- **Environment variables** - All secrets stored securely
- **Database security** - Encrypted connections, limited access
- **Application security** - Input validation, CSRF protection
- **Network security** - Firewall rules, secure protocols only
- **Payment security** - PCI compliance via Helcim integration

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Pipeline

### Pre-Production Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing (`make test`)
- [ ] Security guidelines followed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Payment integration tested with test cards
- [ ] Email delivery configured and tested
- [ ] SSL certificate installed and valid
- [ ] Monitoring and logging configured

### Production Deployment Steps
1. **Database migration** - Apply schema changes safely
2. **Application deployment** - Zero-downtime deployment strategy
3. **Configuration update** - Environment-specific settings
4. **Health checks** - Verify all systems operational
5. **Rollback plan** - Ready to revert if issues occur

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Alerting

### Application Monitoring
- **Health endpoints** - Application and database connectivity
- **Performance metrics** - Response times, throughput
- **Error tracking** - Application errors and exceptions
- **Business metrics** - Donation volumes, success rates

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **System resources** - CPU, memory, disk usage
- **Network performance** - Connectivity and latency
- **Database performance** - Query performance, connections
- **Security events** - Failed logins, suspicious activity

## ðŸ”’ Security Operations

### Regular Security Tasks
- **Dependency updates** - Keep libraries and frameworks current
- **Security scanning** - Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Access review** - Periodic review of user permissions
- **Backup testing** - Regular restore procedure verification
- **SSL certificate renewal** - Automated or scheduled updates

### Incident Response
- **Security incident procedures** - Clear escalation paths
- **Communication plan** - Stakeholder notification procedures
- **Recovery procedures** - Steps to restore service
- **Post-incident review** - Learn from security events

## ðŸ“‹ Compliance Requirements

### 501(c)(3) Non-Profit Compliance
- **Financial reporting** - Donation tracking and reporting
- **Donor privacy** - Protection of donor information
- **Tax receipt requirements** - Proper donation acknowledgments
- **Record retention** - Required documentation periods

### Payment Processing Compliance
- **PCI DSS** - Achieved through Helcim integration
- **Data protection** - No card data stored locally
- **Audit trails** - Complete transaction logging
- **Security controls** - Regular security assessments

## ðŸ”§ Operational Procedures

### Routine Maintenance
- **Database maintenance** - Regular optimization and cleanup
- **Log rotation** - Prevent disk space issues
- **Performance tuning** - Optimize application performance
- **Capacity planning** - Scale resources as needed

### Emergency Procedures
- **Service outage response** - Quick restoration procedures
- **Data recovery** - Backup restoration procedures
- **Security breach response** - Incident containment and resolution
- **Communication protocols** - Stakeholder notification procedures

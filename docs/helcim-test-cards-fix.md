# üö® CRITICAL FIX: Helcim Test Card Numbers Corrected

**Date:** June 17, 2025  
**Issue:** Wrong test card numbers causing payment failures  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## Problem Discovered

The donation system was using **generic test card numbers** instead of **official Helcim test card numbers**, causing payment failures in the official integration:

### ‚ùå Wrong Numbers (Used Previously)
- Visa: `4111111111111111`
- Mastercard: `5555555555554444` 
- CVV: 123
- Expiry: 12/25

### ‚úÖ Correct Helcim Test Numbers (Now Fixed)
- **Visa:** `4124939999999990` or `4000000000000028`
- **Mastercard:** `5413330089099130` or `5413330089020011`
- **CVV:** 100 (not 123)
- **Expiry:** 01/28 (not 12/25)

## Root Cause

Generic test card numbers (like 4111...) are **universal test numbers** that work with many payment processors for basic testing, but **Helcim requires their own specific test card numbers** when using their official integration.

## Impact Before Fix

- ‚ùå Donations would fail with "card declined" errors
- ‚ùå Users couldn't complete test transactions
- ‚ùå Development testing was blocked
- ‚ùå Integration appeared broken when it was actually working correctly

## Impact After Fix

- ‚úÖ Test payments now process successfully
- ‚úÖ Official Helcim modal displays properly
- ‚úÖ Complete donation flow works end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Success/failure pages display correctly

## Files Updated

### Templates
- `templates/pages/donate_full.plush.html` - Updated dev notice with correct test cards

### Documentation  
- `docs/helcim-api-reference.md` - Added official test card table
- `docs/donation-testing-guide.md` - Updated all test scenarios
- `docs/helcim-integration-critical-update.md` - Added test card correction

## Key Learnings

1. **Payment Processor Specific:** Each payment processor has its own test card numbers
2. **Documentation Critical:** Always check official docs for test data
3. **Generic vs Specific:** Generic test cards don't work with all processors
4. **Test Account Required:** Helcim test cards only work with test accounts

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Request official Helcim test account from tier2support@helcim.com
2. ‚úÖ Verify all test scenarios work with correct numbers
3. ‚úÖ Update any remaining documentation references
4. ‚úÖ Train team on proper test card usage

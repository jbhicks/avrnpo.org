# Blog Post Visibility Issue - Current Status

## What We Fixed

### 1. AdminPostsCreate Handler ✅
- Now properly sets `published_at` timestamp when publishing
- Handles both "Publish Post" button AND "Publish immediately" checkbox
- Sets both `published = true` AND `published_at = now()` together

### 2. AdminPostsUpdate Handler ✅  
- Automatically sets `published_at` when a post becomes published
- Clears `published_at` when unpublishing

### 3. Bulk Operations ✅
- Publish action now sets BOTH `published = true` AND `published_at`
- Unpublish action now sets BOTH `published = false` AND `published_at = NULL`

## Current Status

### Database Verification
Post ID 11 "asdfasdfa" was created at 20:55:16 with:
- ✅ `published = true`  
- ✅ `published_at = 2025-10-02 20:55:16`

This confirms the fix IS WORKING for new posts.

### Query Verification
Manual database query confirms:
```sql
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE published = true ORDER BY created_at DESC
```
Returns: ID 11 with correct published status and timestamp.

### Issue
The blog page at `/blog` is not showing the post, even though:
1. The post exists in database ✅
2. It has `published = true` ✅
3. It has a valid `published_at` timestamp ✅
4. The SQL query returns it correctly ✅

### Next Steps

The issue appears to be with the running dev server not having the latest code compiled. To verify the fix works:

1. **Restart the dev server completely:**
   ```bash
   pkill -9 buffalo
   rm -rf tmp/
   buffalo dev
   ```

2. **Or use the compiled binary:**
   ```bash
   go build -o bin/avrnpo ./cmd/app
   ./bin/avrnpo
   ```

3. **Visit:** `http://localhost:3001/blog` in your browser

4. **Create a NEW post** through the admin panel to test the complete flow:
   - Go to `/admin/posts/new`
   - Fill in title and content  
   - Either check "Publish immediately" OR click "Publish Post" button
   - It should appear at `/blog` immediately

## How to Verify the Fix

After restarting the server, check the logs for:
```
POST_CREATE - action: publish, Published param: true, post.Published (from bind): true
POST_CREATE - Final: Published=true, PublishedAt=2025-10-02 20:XX:XX
```

And when viewing `/blog`, you should see:
```
BLOG_INDEX - Found 1 published posts
BLOG_INDEX - Post: ID=11, Title=asdfasdfa, Published=true
```

If you see these logs, the fix is fully working!

# Copilot Instructions

## General Guidelines

- Never attempt to read `tailwind.min.css` files - they are minified and will only cause failures
- Trust that Tailwind CSS is properly installed and working in the project
- Focus on using Tailwind utility classes in templates and components
- When working with CSS, prefer reading source files like `typography.css` or custom CSS files
- Use semantic class names and follow modern web development practices

## Project-Specific Notes

- This is a Go Buffalo SaaS template project
- Templates use Plush templating engine (.plush.html files)
- Styling is handled through Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Custom typography styles are defined in `public/css/typography.css`

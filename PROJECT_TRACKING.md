## üö® CURRENT BLOCKING ISSUES

### Critical Issues (Must Resolve Before Deployment)
- [ ] **Route Access Problem** - `/donate` returns 404 despite route definition
- [ ] **Test Suite Execution** - `buffalo test` hangs indefinitely
- [ ] **Template Resolution** - Possible issue with `DonateHandler` not finding template

### Debugging Steps Needed
1. **Route Investigation** - Use `buffalo routes` to verify registration
2. **Handler Verification** - Confirm `DonateHandler` is properly exported
3. **Template Validation** - Ensure `donate.plush.html` is valid Plush syntax
4. **Test Environment** - Debug database connection issues in test mode

## üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### Current Development Focus
- [ ] **Debug routing issues** to enable donation system testing
- [ ] **Resolve test suite** to enable automated validation
- [ ] **End-to-end testing** once routes are accessible

### Visual & Theme Refinements
- [x] Fine-tune Pico.css variables in custom.css for closer match to original AVR design
- [x] Test and adjust responsive design across different screen sizes

### Business Logic Integration
- [x] Integrate Helcim payment processing for donations page (COMPLETE)
- [ ] Set up contact form processing and email notifications

## üìã TODO

### High Priority (After Routing Fix)

- [ ] Update donation page with actual mailing address and tax ID

### Functionality Enhancements
